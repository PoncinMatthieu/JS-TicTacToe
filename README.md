JS-TicTacToe
============

JavaScript Multiplayer TicTacToe using Node.js

This project includes a server HTTP with Matchmaking entirely in JavaScript for educational purpose.

The TicTacToe is currently played with AJAX and on a table html element, in the future I plan on adding modules to test:
    - Canvas
    - socket.io

CSS is ugly but will be improved in time.
